# Photo Combiner

## What it is
This is a small Android app designed to combine together serveral photos (taken with a seperate app) into a final photo using several algorithms. 
### Average Image
Simply blend all images together into a single image, often used for a "smooth water" effect.
### Median Image
Create an image using the "median pixel value" from pixels in all images. Frequently this ends up being the most common pixel value and is used to remove moving temporary objects like cars our people waling around.
### Median Image
This mode is experimental, it should use the most common occuring pixel value and be an even better version of the median image mode above

## How to use for best results
1. Download an automatic clicker app (sometimes call intervalometer) to trigger a photo every couple of minutes or seconds.  An example would be [auto clicker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.truedevelopersstudio.automatictap.autoclicker&pcampaignid=web_share)
2. Place your camera on a tripod, the images needs to be perfectly aligned, and will be ruined if the camera is not stable during shooting (including wind shaking the tripod!)
3. Open Photo Combiner
  1. Select image types to generate
  2. Click "generate" and select the images
  3. Wait for images to be processed (**be warned, an external power supply is highly recommended**)
